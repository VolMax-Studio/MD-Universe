## STRATEGIC COMMITMENTS

### NO NEW PROJECTS Until MVP Ships
**Commitment:** Focus ONLY on MD Universe for 30 days
**Why:** History of project-switching kills execution
**Exception:** None! (Write ideas down, don't act on them)

### Daily Minimum Viable Progress
**Commitment:** Every day must have:
- 30 min productive work
- 1 tangible output
- 1 Git commit
- 1 sprint item checked
**Why:** Small daily progress compounds to big results

### Physical Accountability System
**Commitment:** 
- Daily log filled honestly
- Evening review ritual
- Weekly sprint review
**Why:** Honest tracking = real progress

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### AR Foundation over Native ARCore/ARKit
**Decision:** Use Unity AR Foundation
**Reasoning:**
- Cross-platform (Android + iOS)
- Single codebase
- Future-proof
- Easier learning curve

### Local-First Architecture
**Decision:** No cloud backend initially
**Reasoning:**
- Privacy (user data stays on device)
- Offline functionality
- Zero backend costs
- Simpler MVP scope
**Future:** Optional cloud sync in v2.0

### C# over Other Languages
**Decision:** Stick with Unity's C#
**Reasoning:**
- Unity native language
- Strong typing helps catch bugs
- Great tooling support
- Your existing knowledge

## PIVOTS & CHANGES

### 2025-10-25: Deferred Unity Hub to Day 2
**Original plan:** Install Unity Day 1
**Reality:** Kernel sandbox issues, late night troubleshooting
**Decision:** Complete docs Day 1, Unity Day 2 with fresh mind
**Reasoning:**
- Documentation = strategic foundation (more important)
- Unity = tool (can wait)
- Better to complete one thing than half-finish two
- Mental energy management
**Lesson:** Strategy > Tools, Complete > Perfect

## BUSINESS DECISIONS

### Pricing Strategy
**Decision:** $19 / $49 / $99 tiers
**Reasoning:**
- Competitive with subscription alternatives
- One-time payment = customer-friendly
- Lifetime tier creates urgency
**Comparison:** Roam = $180/year, we charge $49 once!

### Marketing Channels
**Decision:** Focus on organic (Reddit, Twitter, Product Hunt)
**Reasoning:**
- Zero ad budget initially
- Community-driven = better product-market fit
- Authentic indie hacker story resonates
**Investment:** Time, not money

### Launch Timeline
**Decision:** 30 days to MVP, launch immediately after
**Reasoning:**
- Perfect is enemy of done
- Beta feedback shapes v2.0
- Revenue validates (or invalidates) quickly
- Indie hacker philosophy: ship fast, iterate

## PERSONAL COMMITMENTS

### Work from Home Focus
**Commitment:** Build sustainable remote income
**Goal:** 50,000 din/month minimum from tech products
**Why:** Electrical cicija jobs crush soul
**Path:** MD Universe → TikTok monetization → AI Energy Monitor

### Health & Balance
**Commitment:** 
- Daily exercise maintained
- Healthy eating continues
- Coding in focused blocks, not marathons
**Why:** Sustainable creativity requires physical health

### No More Cicija Clients
**Commitment:** Never again work for clients who don't value expertise
**Reasoning:** 
- 6 months on 4 stans = 12.5€/day trauma
- Premium pricing or no pricing
- Walk away from low-ballers
**Result:** Only work that respects 20 years experience

## LESSONS LEARNED

### "Brainstorming ≠ Execution"
**Insight:** Having 1500 MD conversations means nothing without action
**Change:** Physical accountability system (daily logs, honest tracking)
**Application:** Daily check-ins, honest progress tracking

### "Tools Enable, But Don't Replace Work"
**Insight:** Claude Pro + Unity are powerful, but YOU must code
**Change:** Clear minimum viable daily progress metrics
**Application:** 30 min productive work = non-negotiable baseline

### "One Focus, One Goal"
**Insight:** Multiple projects = zero completed projects
**Change:** MD Universe ONLY for 30 days
**Application:** Write new ideas down, don't start them

### "Complete > Perfect"
**Insight:** Better to finish documentation than half-install Unity
**Change:** Prioritize completion over perfection
**Application:** Day 1 docs complete = WIN! Unity Day 2 = smart!
