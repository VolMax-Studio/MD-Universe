# üöÄ MD UNIVERSE - Active Development Sprint

## PROJECT VISION

**"MD Universe"** - AR/VR Knowledge Visualization Application
Navigate your Second Brain through Space and Time

### The Problem We Solve
- 1500+ MD files scattered across folders
- Endless scrolling, context lost
- No spatial organization
- Forgotten insights buried in archives

### Our Revolutionary Solution
- **3D AR timeline** of all MD files floating in space
- **Gesture navigation** through dates and connections
- **Direct file access** - tap to open content
- **Visual connections** - threads between related notes
- **Folder galaxies** - clusters of related content
